## [1.0.0 rc8] - 2021-09-02
- Temporal Fix to S(Q) weird behavior for small Q. (0<=Q<1)
  Because of the abnormal results for small Q, and in the process of
  getting better results for small Q, we decided to remove the unreliable
  information for this segment, now we report for Q above 1.0.
- Added -q/--q_bin_width parameter in order to further personalize the
  structure factor options.
- Updated the "aPdH.cell" file, in order to correctly reflect the
  structure of the article.
- Added arguments to tests in the Makefile:
  -a in test 1,
  -b in test 2,
  -q in test 3,
  -i was already in test 4,
  -w in test 5,
  -r in test 6.
