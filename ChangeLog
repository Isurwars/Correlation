# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.6] 2026-01-13

### Added
- Icosahedron Angle Test in `tests/AngleTests.cpp`.
- Missing color definitions to `ui/Theme.slint`.

### Changed
- Refactored `ui/AppWindow.slint` to use `VerticalLayout` and `GroupBox` for better UI organization.
- Updated project version to 1.6 in `CMakeLists.txt`.

### Fixed
- Fixed unit conversion error in `ui/AppWindow.slint`.
- Fixed "Unknown property max-height" error in `ui/AppWindow.slint`.

## [1.5] 2026-01-07

### Refactor
- Fused `Angle_Reproduction_tests.cpp` and `PAD_tests.cpp` into a single `tests/AngleTests.cpp` file for better organization.
- Refactored `AtomID` from a struct to a simple `std::uint32_t` alias, removing the unused `offset` field to simplify the codebase.
- Updated `Atom::setID` and all `AtomID` usages (e.g., removing `.value` accesses) to match the new type definition.

### Added
- Comprehensive neighbor detection tests in `StructureAnalyzer_test.cpp`:
    - `FindsNoNeighborsForIsolatedAtom`: Validates isolation of single atoms.
    - `FindsNeighborsBasedOnBondCutoff`: Ensures bond radius + bond factor logic is strictly followed.
    - `EnforcesNeighborSymmetry`: Checks that neighbor lists are symmetric (A sees B => B sees A).
    - `HandlesPeriodicSelfInteractions`: Verifies self-interaction logic across periodic boundaries.
    - `TriangleMoleculeConnectivity`: Validates connectivity in cyclic triangular structures.
- New `SiTetrahedron_5Atoms` test case in `Angle_Reproduction_tests.cpp`:
    - Simulates a full Silicon tetrahedron (1 center + 4 neighbors).
    - Verifies exact count of 6 tetrahedral angles (109.47°).
    - Explicitly checks for 0 "other" (unexpected) angles.
- New `BondCutoffPopulationCorrectness` test in `Cell_test.cpp` to verify `bond_cutoffs_sq_` management.

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug**: `Cell::setBondFactor` now properly clears the cached `bond_cutoffs_sq_`, ensuring that runtime changes to the bond factor (e.g., during tests) are immediately applied.
- **Data Consistency**: Verified Covalent Radii in `PhysicalData.hpp` against Pyykkö (2009) data. Reverted Bismuth (Bi) radius from 1.50 Å to 1.51 Å to maintain consistency with the dataset.
- Fixed `ctest` configuration issues related to missing `DartConfiguration.tcl` by ensuring proper CMake regeneration.

- Switch to std::filesystem to generate paths.
- Added Smoothing option: Kernel Smoothing with Gaussian Kernel.
- Added BumpKernel as second option, more kernels will be added.

- Added initial support for Voronoi and Voronoi index. (Road to 1.1)

## [1.0.3] 2021-10-12
- Major refactor of the code in preparation for MultiThreading.
- The code now comply with google c++ style guidelines.
- Modify the name for the Coordination Number (Z).
- Modify the labels in the coordination number file (Z)to comply
  with the standard atom A surrounded by atoms B: A by B.

## [1.0.2] 2021-09-17
- Minor style corrections to paper.md and README.md.
- Updated DOI for JOSS paper.

## [1.0.1] 2021-09-11

## [1.0.0 rc9] 2021-09-06
- Added test 8, an structure of amorphous Palladium-Gold-Hydrogen,
  the structure was provided by Alejandro de Leon and Salvador Villareal.
  This new test should take at least 1 hour and require more RAM.
- Added new option '-n'/"--normalize", this parameter change between
  weighted partials (default), or normalized partials.

## [1.0.0 rc8] - 2021-09-02
- Temporal Fix to S(Q) weird behavior for small Q. (0<=Q<1)
  Because of the abnormal results for small Q, and in the process of
  getting better results for small Q, we decided to remove the unreliable
  information for this segment, now we report for Q above 1.0.
- Added -q/--q_bin_width parameter in order to further personalize the
  structure factor options.
- Updated the "aPdH.cell" file, in order to correctly reflect the
  structure of the article.

  -i was already in test 4,
  -w in test 5,
  -r in test 6.
- Fixed padding in output files (purely cosmetic).
- Fixed Tests to match new padding and options (see above).
- Update to documentation: README.md, paper.md and command line help
  to reflect current functionality.

  This test should take several minutes and a large amount of RAM.
- Added a new option to clean the test directory (make clean-test)

### Modify
- clean-local option now leaves a working Makefile and the Binary.
