- Temporal Fix to S(Q) weird behavior for small Q. (0<=Q<1)
  Because of the abnormal results for small Q, and in the process of

  structure factor options.
- Updated the "aPdH.cell" file, in order to correctly reflect the
  structure of the article.
- Added arguments to tests in the Makefile:
  -a in test 1,
  -b in test 2,
  -q in test 3,
  -i was already in test 4,
  -w in test 5,
  -r in test 6.
- Fixed padding in output files (purely cosmetic).
- Fixed Tests to match new padding and options (see above).
- Update to documentation: README.md, paper.md and command line help
  to reflect current functionality.
