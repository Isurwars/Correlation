# **Correlation** Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community includes:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

All **Correlation** forums and spaces are meant for professional interactions,
and any behavior which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
professional setting is unacceptable.

## Our Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to Isaías Rodríguez at <isurwars@gmail.com> or Ariel A. Valladares at
<valladar@unam.mx>.

The Project Steward will determine whether the Code of Conduct was violated,
and will issue an appropriate sanction, possibly including a written warning or
expulsion from the project, project sponsored spaces, or project forums.

We ask that you make a good-faith effort to resolve your conflict via the
conflict resolution policy before submitting a report.


## Enforcement

If the Project Stewards receive a report alleging a violation of this Code of
Conduct, the Project Stewards will notify the accused of the report, and provide
them an opportunity to discuss the report before a sanction is issued.
The Project Stewards will do their utmost to keep the reporter anonymous.
